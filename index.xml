      <description>Introduction Last time, we talked about data sources and coding system. Electronic Health Record system is where the patient&amp;rsquo;s records being stored. Different coding system(ICD-9, ICD-10, SNOWMED-CT, etc) are being used to ensure consistency and communication. This post will talk about Clinical Decision Support System(CDSS), a computer-based programs that analyzes data from EHR.
Clinical Decision Support System(CDSS) Clinical Decision Support System is used for assisting patient-related decision making process. It can effectively determine the optimal treatment, estimating clinical and financial outcomes of different treatment.</description>

      <description>Introduction Healthcare analytics has gained more popularity in the recent years. Healthcare analytics includes but not limited to: biomedical image analysis, sensor data analysis, biomedical signal analysis, clinical text mining, clinical prediction models, Clinical Decision Support Systems(CDSS), fraud detection, etc.
This post will talk about healthcare data sources, coding system, and
1. Electronic Health Record (EHR) EHR, or electric health record is where patient&amp;rsquo;s medical histories are stored at. With EHR, patient&amp;rsquo;s medical records are easier to retrieved by health providers.</description>

      <description>Association rule mining Last time, we talked about healthcare analytics using predictive or descriptive methods. This post will talk about association rule mining, which aims to find co-occurrences of disease carried by a patient using the health care repository.
The research has proved that getting one disease can lead to one or more several disease. For example, a patient with diabetes is more likely to have other conditions, such as hypertension, and increase the risk of heart disease.</description>

      <description>Faster Diagnosis, Better Treatment: For a long time, healthcare professionals have been using data science to optimize patient outcomes. The application can include but not limited to:
 predictive analytics of frequent medical event sequence; predict healthcare event/costs/readmission rate; clustering medical records, or predicting causations between medical events; Classifying medical images/videos, etc.  Using data science allows the industry to draw actionable insights in a cost-effective way. For example, Stanford ML Group developed a model which can diagnose irregular heart rhythms from single-lead ECG signals.</description>

      <description>This post introduce how to configure an apex domain to your hugo site. A lot of people prefer to have a custom domain instead &amp;ldquo;http:XXXX.github.io&amp;rdquo;. Let&amp;rsquo;s go through the steps to add your domain name to your hugo site:
Step 1: acquire a domain: I got my domain name from Google Domains. Depends on different domain names, the prices are different. For example, my domain name &amp;ldquo;JiaxinZheng.com&amp;rdquo; costs 12 bucks per year.</description>

      <description>Introduction Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common types of heart disease in America. Making early prognosis can help high risk potential patients to change lifesyle and reduce the chance of getting it. The objective of the project is to determine the risk factors for predicting the probability of developing CHD.
The ‚Äòframingham‚Äô dataset provides information whether the participants developed Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) after ten years of the study.</description>

      <description>Understanding data is one of the most important steps for anyone starting out a machine learning project. Exploratory Data Analysis is one of the ways to do that. ‚ÄúEDA is performed in order to define and refine the selection of feature variables that will be used for machine learning‚Äù. This post briefly talks about EDA and Bivariate Analysis.
The post will cover:

      <description>Sales analysis is a way to evaluate the performance of sales by analyzing sales data. In order to improve sales effectiveness and make smart decisions, it‚Äôs important to conduct sales analysis regularly. Today, I decided to share one of the sales analysis projects for UNIQLO sales data.
About UNIQLO: Uniqlo is one of the brands in Fast Retailing, a global company that operates multiple fashion brands. UNIQLO generates about 1.9 trillion Yen in annual revenue (FY 2019) from 2200 stores globally.</description>

      <description>Today, I am going to talk about Feature Engineer, and more specifically, PCA which is one technique in feature extraction.
Feature Engineer is an important part of machine learning. Like a quote showed above, how your algorithm does, highly depends on your data. Feature engineer include feature selection and feature extraction. We are only going to focus on feature extraction&amp;mdash;PCA here.
What is PCA and why we are doing it?üí≠ PCA refers to Principal Component Analysis.</description>

      <description>In machine learning, we usually split the data into training and testing sets so that we can evaluate the model(s). This method, however, is not reliable because the accuracy of your model is largely depend on what you got! Accuracy obtained from one test set can be very different than another test set. This post will talk about K-fold Cross Validation.
The Validation Set Approach:‚ùì Usually before we train a model, we spilt the data into training and test set.</description>
