      <description>Association rule mining Last time, we talked about healthcare analytics using predictive or descriptive methods. This post will talk about association rule mining, which aims to find co-occurrences of disease carried by a patient using the health care repository.
The research has proved that getting one disease can lead to one or more several disease. For example, a patient with diabetes is more likely to have other conditions, such as hypertension, and increase the risk of heart disease.</description>

      <description>Faster Diagnosis, Better Treatment: For a long time, healthcare professionals have been using data science to optimize patient outcomes. The application can include but not limited to:
 predictive analytics of frequent medical event sequence; predict healthcare event/costs/readmission rate; clustering medical records, or predicting causations between medical events; Classifying medical images/videos, etc.  Using data science allows the industry to draw actionable insights in a cost-effective way. For example, Stanford ML Group developed a model which can diagnose irregular heart rhythms from single-lead ECG signals.</description>

      <description>Understanding data is one of the most important steps for anyone starting out a machine learning project. Exploratory Data Analysis is one of the ways to do that. ‚ÄúEDA is performed in order to define and refine the selection of feature variables that will be used for machine learning‚Äù. This post briefly talks about EDA and Bivariate Analysis.
The post will cover:

      <description>Today, I am going to talk about Feature Engineer, and more specifically, PCA which is one technique in feature extraction.
Feature Engineer is an important part of machine learning. Like a quote showed above, how your algorithm does, highly depends on your data. Feature engineer include feature selection and feature extraction. We are only going to focus on feature extraction&amp;mdash;PCA here.
What is PCA and why we are doing it?üí≠ PCA refers to Principal Component Analysis.</description>

      <description>In machine learning, we usually split the data into training and testing sets so that we can evaluate the model(s). This method, however, is not reliable because the accuracy of your model is largely depend on what you got! Accuracy obtained from one test set can be very different than another test set. This post will talk about K-fold Cross Validation.
The Validation Set Approach:‚ùì Usually before we train a model, we spilt the data into training and test set.</description>
